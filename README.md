An encrypted database for contacts with scriptable hooks to social media and other services.

## Basic plan
3 projects with 3 scopes:
1. this project: a simple contact database library with tagging and hooks written in C
2. configurations: settings for interfacing database with proprietary services (so one per service)
3. the client(s): still undecided if I should make more than one client, but plan is have a very intuitive cross platform database client with all the bells and whistles (Comes with sensible configuration installed) ideally comes bundled as a single executable.

## Planned Features
- import contacts from social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Gmail, etc.)
- social media hooks
    - click a button and dm a friend on their favourite platform
    - download a contact's feed
    - add custom functionality
- searching
- tags
- support for thousands of contacts
- database is fully encrypted

## Why?
Modern platforms use their high user counts to keep us trapped in their silos.
I think this is a technology problem.
Hear me out.

The fastest way to message your someone you know currently is:
1. remember where to message them
2. go to app/website
3. find contact
4. send messagk

The 1st and 2nd steps add friction to switching between platforms.
So slowly over time, one site is chosen per "type" of relationship.
For example one for work (LinkedIn), one for family (Facebook/Whatsapp), and one per friend group (Instagram/Discord/Snapchat).

In this environment competition is basically removed.
Things users might otherwise value (performance, design, privacy) become irrelevant.
Whichever platform lucks out becomes the first in its category and will stay there.

Here's where I come in.
This project (‚ö†Ô∏è ONCE FINISHED ‚ö†Ô∏è) provides a fast and intuitive interface to get back control.
Want to message a friend? Here's how:
1. search friend in contact app
2. click message
3. friend's preferred chat opens with dm ready to go

If this process is faster than accessing a service normaly then people will not only be more open to new platforms, 
but they will also prioritize platforms that are highly integrated to this system.


In short, some of the benefits:
- Make communicating on the internet more deliberate
- Remove barrier to entry
- Keep up with

# DONE:
    - get tag names
    - set tags
    - add fields
    - set fields
